## STREAMS - 4 Additional Modes for Sidechain Pumping Effects

Mode selection by long pressing the mode button.
The new mode (yellow) will change the behavior regarding the excite input.
In envelope, follower and vactrol mode it behaves like an inverted LP-VCA. I use this for my sidechain pumping.
For compressor mode it currently behaves like a simple (non-inverted) LP-VCA .<br>
<br>
LED(green) = the four standard factory mode <br>
LED(yellow) = four new sidechain pumping modes based on excite input (for envelope, vactrol, follower, compressor)<br>
LED(red) = all six factory alternative modes (incl. the easter egg Lorenz mode)<br>
