## STREAMS - 4 Additional Modes for Sidechain Pumping Effects

I also made the easter egg (LORENZ curve) a bit easier to access.<br>
<br>
Mode selection by long pressing the mode button.
The new mode (yellow) will change the behavior of streams to the signal of the excite input.
In principle for envelope, follower and vactrol mode it is inverted to simplify sidechain pumping.
For compressor mode it currently behaves like a simple LP-Gate/VCA .<br>
<br>
LED(green) = 4 standard factory mode <br>
LED(yellow) = 4 new sidechain pumping modes based on excite input (for envelope, vactrol, follower, compressor)<br>
LED(red) = 6 factory alternative modes (incl. 6 easter egg mode)<br>
